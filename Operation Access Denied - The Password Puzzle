Scenario Analysis: Operation Access Denied - The Password Puzzle



Initial Assessment: The recent spear-phishing attack and the inconsistencies in access control and password management suggest a significant risk. Delta Tech appears to have a reactive rather than a proactive approach to security, which might have contributed to the successful spear-phishing attack.

Access Control: I would apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP), ensuring employees only have access to systems necessary for their job functions. This would involve:

Implementing a robust identity and access management (IAM) system to automate provisioning and deprovisioning of access.
Regularly reviewing and auditing access rights to prevent access creep.
Enforcing strong authentication methods, potentially including multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Password Management: To enhance password management, I would:

Implement a company-wide password policy requiring strong, unique passwords.
Consider the use of a password manager to assist users in creating and storing complex passwords.
Enforce regular password changes and prevent the reuse of old passwords.
Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute force attacks.
Policy Development: To support the enhanced practices, I would develop and implement clear policies around:

Access control, detailing how access rights should be granted, reviewed, and revoked.
Password management, specifying password complexity requirements, change intervals, and storage guidelines.
Incident response, providing clear procedures for responding to security incidents like the recent spear-phishing attack.
Incident Analysis: The successful spear-phishing attack suggests employees may lack awareness of phishing techniques and the importance of password security. The incident also shows that attackers have targeted the company, which might suggest a higher threat level.

Remediation & Prevention: To remediate the threats and prevent future incidents, consider:

Providing security awareness training to employees, focusing on phishing and safe password practices.
Enhancing email security measures to better filter out phishing emails.
Implementing regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Ensuring all systems, especially those exposed to the internet, are patched and updated regularly.
Remember, this is an example solution based on the scenario. In a real-world situation, the specific steps and conclusions might vary based on the actual details of the system and the tools and resources available.
