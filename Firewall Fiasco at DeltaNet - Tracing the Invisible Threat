Scenario Analysis: Firewall Fiasco at DeltaNet - Tracing the Invisible Threat


Initial Response: The first step should be to mitigate the outgoing traffic to the botnet command and control servers. Configuring the Palo Alto Networks firewall to temporarily block this traffic could help halt any ongoing data exfiltration or malicious activity.

Investigation: During the investigation, these specific elements should be the focus:

Outgoing Traffic Analysis: The significant increase in outgoing traffic should be thoroughly analyzed. The type of traffic, the specific IPs involved, and the timing should be evaluated for any patterns or indications of malicious activity.

Network Performance Issues: The reported network performance issues at Gamma Industries could be related to the increased traffic. Network logs and bandwidth usage reports should be reviewed to identify any anomalies or potential causes for the slow internet speed and connection drops.

Firewall Analysis: The capabilities of the Palo Alto Networks firewall can be leveraged during the investigation. The firewall logs should be reviewed for any detected threats or unusual activity. The firewall's threat intelligence data can provide insights into the nature of the botnet command and control servers.

Network Traffic Analysis: Given the detected traffic to botnet command and control servers, it's crucial to determine if Gamma Industries' network is part of a botnet. Checking for command and control communication patterns and any signs of botnet-related malware in the traffic data should be a priority.

Findings & Conclusions: Based on the investigation, it's likely that Gamma Industries' network has been compromised and is now part of a botnet, which explains the unusual outgoing traffic and the network performance issues. The evidence supporting this conclusion includes the firewall's detection of traffic to known botnet command and control servers, the patterns in the outgoing traffic, and the correlation with the network performance issues.

Remediation & Prevention: To remediate the issues, Gamma Industries should be advised to conduct a thorough malware scan and cleanup of their network. Any compromised systems should be isolated and cleaned. 
To prevent future occurrences, DeltaNet should consider implementing advanced threat detection features on their Palo Alto Networks firewall, such as WildFire, to better detect and prevent botnet activity. Additionally, regular network traffic monitoring should be conducted to detect any unusual activity promptly.
