Scenario Analysis: Skyline Mysteries - The AWS Cloud Conundrum

Initial Response: The immediate steps should involve minimizing the ongoing costs and potential harm:

Terminate the unfamiliar EC2 instances after documenting their details for further investigation.
Temporarily restrict data transfer from the S3 buckets showing increased activity.
Alert users about the phishing attempt and advise them not to click on any suspicious links.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all IAM accounts, if not already done.




Investigation: The focus during the investigation should be on:

S3 Buckets: Look for public access permissions or unfamiliar access patterns in the S3 buckets.
EC2 Instances: Analyze the terminated EC2 instances for unfamiliar software or configurations.
Phishing Emails: Investigate the email headers to trace their origin.



AWS Log Analysis: AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and AWS GuardDuty can provide valuable insights:

CloudTrail: Review logs for unusual API activity, particularly involving the affected S3 buckets and EC2 instances.
Config: Identify any recent changes in the configuration of S3, EC2, and IAM services.
GuardDuty: Check for any threat detections related to the incident.



Security Analysis: To analyze the security posture of Skyline's AWS infrastructure, consider factors like:

IAM policies and practices, including MFA and least privilege access.
The security of S3 buckets, particularly public access and bucket policies.
Security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) for EC2 instances.





Findings & Conclusions: Based on the investigation, the potential conclusions could include:

Unauthorized access to the AWS environment, possibly due to compromised IAM credentials, leading to the launch of EC2 instances.
Misconfiguration of S3 buckets, allowing for increased data transfer costs.
Phishing emails may be an independent event or connected with the AWS incident if the same threat actor is involved.







Remediation & Prevention: To remediate the issues found and prevent future incidents, consider:

Enforcing strong IAM policies, including MFA and least privilege access.
Regularly reviewing and securing S3 bucket permissions.
Implementing a security monitoring and alerting solution.
Regular security assessments of the AWS environment.
Training staff on identifying and reporting phishing attempts.
Remember, this is an example solution based on the scenario. In a real-world situation, the specific steps and conclusions might vary based on the actual details of the system and the tools and resources available.
