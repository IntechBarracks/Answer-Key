Scenario Analysis: Windows Woes at GammaTech - The Mysterious Malware Manifestation



Initial Response: The immediate steps would be to isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent potential spreading of any malware and to stop the unknown_process.exe on each system. Backup essential data if possible. Inform the incident response team about the suspicious process.

Investigation: During the investigation, focus on:

System Analysis: Examine the affected systems for any other anomalies besides high CPU usage. Look for any recently installed programs, unusual network traffic, or suspicious files.
Process Analysis: Investigate the properties of unknown_process.exe, such as its location on the system, its creation and modification dates, and any associated files.
Event Log Analysis: Review the Windows Event Logs for any events related to unknown_process.exe or other anomalies that occurred around the same time.
Windows Event Log Analysis: Use the Event Viewer to find any events related to unknown_process.exe. Look for events such as application errors, system warnings, and security events that might provide more information about the process and its actions on the system.

Malware Analysis: Upload the unknown_process.exe to a malware analysis tool or service, such as VirusTotal. This can help identify if the process is known malware. If possible, analyze the code of the process in a secure, isolated environment to understand its functionality and potential impact.

Findings & Conclusions: Based on the system behavior, the properties of unknown_process.exe, and the results of the malware analysis, it's likely that unknown_process.exe is a form of malware that the installed antivirus software is not detecting. This malware is likely causing the system slowdown and high CPU usage.

Remediation & Prevention: To address this incident, remove unknown_process.exe from the affected systems and perform a thorough cleanup. Update the antivirus software and perform a full system scan. If the malware analysis provided any indicators of compromise (IOCs), use these to check all systems in the network for signs of the same malware. Going forward, ensure that all systems are regularly updated, and consider adding additional layers of security, such as behavior-based malware detection tools.
