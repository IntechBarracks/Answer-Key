**Solution Walkthrough: The Broken Bridge - Palo Alto GlobalProtect VPN Malfunction**

1. **Initial Assessment:** Given the symptoms and the recent network maintenance activities, my primary suspicion is that changes made during the maintenance have led to the malfunctioning of the GlobalProtect VPN gateway. This hypothesis is further supported by the error messages in the firewall and GlobalProtect logs, indicating a failure in configuration synchronization and client configuration distribution.

2. **System Analysis:** I would begin my investigation by analyzing the firewall and GlobalProtect logs. The "Config sync failed" messages in the firewall logs hint at a problem with configuration synchronization between the firewall and the VPN gateway. On the other hand, the "GlobalProtect portal client configuration failed" messages in the GlobalProtect logs suggest an issue with the client configurations being provided by the VPN gateway. The network traffic logs showing failed SSL/TLS handshakes also suggest a problem in the communication between the VPN clients and the gateway. These logs collectively hint at an issue with the VPN gateway configuration or operation.

3. **Problem Identification:** Based on my analysis, I believe that the VPN issue is due to incorrect or unsynchronized configurations on the VPN gateway. During the network maintenance activities, changes might have been made to the firewall or VPN gateway configurations, which are now causing the VPN connections to fail.

4. **Resolution Strategies:** To resolve the issue, I would:
    - Verify and rectify the VPN gateway configuration: I would compare the current configuration with a known good configuration (if available) or the recommended settings, making sure that the configurations are correct and synchronized with the firewall.
    - Check for updates and patches: Sometimes, a software or firmware update might cause issues if there are bugs or compatibility problems. I would check the vendor's release notes or bulletins for any known issues and their resolutions.
    - Roll back recent changes: If no resolution is found, and if it was confirmed that changes during the maintenance activities led to the issue, I would consider rolling back these changes.

5. **Incident Response:** After resolving the issue, I would inform all stakeholders about the incident, the cause, the steps taken to resolve it, and the measures to prevent a recurrence. I would document the incident in detail for future reference and conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in our processes and systems.

This resolution strategy focuses on identifying and rectifying the configuration issues that are likely causing the GlobalProtect VPN to malfunction. By restoring the correct configurations, VPN connectivity for the users should be reestablished.
