Scenario Analysis: Web Woes at BetaShop - The Case of the Crashing Cart




Initial Response: The first step should be to mitigate the impact on customers. This could involve rolling back the shopping cart application to a previous stable version if available, or enabling a maintenance mode that communicates to customers that the site is temporarily unavailable. At the same time, it would be critical to gather as much information as possible about the surge in HTTP requests, including source IP addresses, request headers, and request frequency.

Investigation: During the investigation, these specific elements should be focused on:

Website Crashes: Analyze error logs related to the website crashes. This could help pinpoint any specific issues with the shopping cart application. If error logs are not sufficient, it may be necessary to replicate the issue in a controlled environment.

HTTP Requests: The surge in HTTP requests needs to be examined closely. Determine if these requests are legitimate or if they show signs of being automated or malicious.

Web Application Analysis: Investigating the shopping cart application should involve a thorough review of recent changes to the application code. If any updates or changes were made around the time the issues started, they should be investigated as a potential cause. Additionally, application logs should be reviewed for any unusual activity or error messages.

HTTP Traffic Analysis: The surge in HTTP requests could be an attempt at a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, intended to overwhelm the server and disrupt the shopping cart functionality. Analyzing the nature of the requests, their frequency, and their source could provide more insight into this possibility.

Findings & Conclusions: Based on the investigation, it's likely that the website is under a DoS attack, which is causing the shopping cart application to crash. The surge in HTTP requests, particularly if they are unusually frequent or originate from a small number of IP addresses, supports this conclusion. Additionally, if no issues are found with the shopping cart application itself, this further points to the issue being caused by the influx of traffic rather than an application error.

Remediation & Prevention: To remediate the issues, BetaShop should consider implementing rate limiting on their server to manage the influx of requests. They should also consider configuring their firewall to block traffic from the IP addresses responsible for the surge in requests. To prevent future occurrences, BetaShop should consider investing in a more robust application security solution that can automatically detect and mitigate DoS attacks. Regular monitoring of traffic patterns and timely application of security patches and updates will also help prevent such incidents.
