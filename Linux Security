### Answers

1. B) Security Enhanced Linux - SELinux is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.
2. A) chmod - This command changes the permissions of a file or directory.
3. C) The superuser with all privileges - The 'root' user in a Linux system has administrative access, or "superuser" permissions. 
4. C) Manages network packet filtering and NAT - The 'iptables' command is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.
5. A) chown - This command changes the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link.
6. B) /etc/ssh/sshd_config - This is the main configuration file for the sshd daemon which controls remote ssh logins.
7. B) tcpdump - This powerful command-line packet analyzer allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP packets being transmitted or received over a network.
8. C) ssh - The ssh command is used to log into a remote machine in a secure way, encrypting all communication.
9. C) md5sum - This command-line utility calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 hashes, or "checksums," for a file.
10. B) AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) - AIDE creates a database from the regular expression rules that it finds from the config file.
11. B) iptables - iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.
12. A) /etc/ssh/sshd_config - This is the main configuration file for the sshd daemon which controls remote ssh logins.
13. C) systemctl - This is the systemd system and service manager, which can be used to introspect and control the state of the systemd system and service manager.
14. C) unattended-upgrades - This package can download and install security upgrades automatically and unattended, taking care to only install packages from the configured origin sites.
15. B) GnuPG - GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a free software replacement for Symantec's PGP cryptographic software suite, which is used for securing email communications.
