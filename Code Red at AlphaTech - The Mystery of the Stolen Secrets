Scenario Analysis: Code Red at AlphaTech - The Mystery of the Stolen Secrets

Here is the detailed solution for the scenario:

1.	Initial Response: The immediate steps should involve isolating Lisa's workstation from the network to stop any potential ongoing data exfiltration or malware spread. Also, temporary access restrictions should be placed on SSH services until the nature of the brute-force attacks is understood.

2.	Investigation: During the investigation, these specific elements should be focused on:

Analyzing SSH Traffic: The sudden increase in SSH traffic from Lisa's workstation should be investigated. Identifying the unfamiliar IP address it is communicating with and checking it against threat intelligence databases can provide insights about potential threats.

Network Drive Access: The access logs for the network drive containing the design files should be reviewed to check for any unauthorized access or alterations to file permissions.

Brute-force Attack Analysis: The logs related to the brute-force attacks should be analyzed to determine if any of the attempts were successful. Check if there's a correlation between the SSH traffic and the timing of the brute-force attacks.

3.	Workstation Analysis: Lisa's workstation should be thoroughly checked for any signs of compromise such as unusual processes, unfamiliar applications, and any recently downloaded files or email attachments. Malware scans should be performed as well.

4.	Network Security Analysis: The sudden surge in brute-force attacks should be treated as a potential threat. It would be crucial to check if any accounts were compromised as a result of these attacks and if so, those account credentials should be immediately reset.

5.	Findings & Conclusions: Based on the investigation, it's likely that Lisa's workstation was compromised via a malware infection, possibly from a phishing email or malicious download. The malware might have exfiltrated the design files via SSH to the external IP. The brute-force attacks could be a diversion or a secondary attempt to gain further access to the network.

6.	Remediation & Prevention: To remediate the issues, the malware should be removed from Lisa's workstation, potentially requiring a full system reset. Any compromised account credentials should be reset. The firewall should be updated to block the suspicious external IP address. To prevent future occurrences, the company should consider implementing multi-factor authentication for SSH access, conduct regular staff training on phishing and other cyber threats, and consider additional network monitoring capabilities to detect unusual data transfers more effectively.
