### Scenario-Based Cryptography Quiz

4. Alice, a cybersecurity engineer, is working on a secure communication protocol where the encryption and decryption keys are the same. Which type of encryption is she likely using?

    A) Symmetric encryption
    B) Asymmetric encryption
    C) Public key encryption
    D) Hash encryption

5. Bob has been asked to implement a cryptographic solution that ensures the integrity of data. Which of the following should he primarily consider?

    A) Digital Signature
    B) Symmetric Encryption
    C) Public Key Infrastructure
    D) Secret Key Encryption

6. Carol is designing a secure system for storing user passwords. She decides to use a method that transforms the passwords into a fixed size text, which can't be feasibly converted back. Which cryptographic method is she likely using?

    A) Symmetric encryption
    B) Asymmetric encryption
    C) Hashing
    D) Digital signature

### Answers

1. A) Advanced Encryption Standard - AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
2. D) AES - As of the knowledge cutoff in September 2021, AES is generally considered the most secure for data encryption.
3. B) Asymmetric-key algorithm - Asymmetric cryptography, or public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: one for encryption (public key) and one for decryption (private key).

4. A) Symmetric encryption - Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both the encryption and decryption processes.
5. A) Digital Signature - Digital signatures primarily provide data integrity, assuring the recipient that the message has not been altered in transit.
6. C) Hashing - Hash functions are used for storing passwords securely. They transform the password into a fixed-size text (the hash), and this process is not reversible.




7. David, a security analyst, has been asked to implement an encryption method that supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits for a new software. Which encryption method should he choose?

    A) DES
    B) RSA
    C) AES
    D) MD5

8. Emma has been tasked to securely exchange symmetric keys over the internet for her organization. Which cryptographic method would be most suitable for this purpose?

    A) Hashing
    B) Digital signatures
    C) Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    D) Symmetric encryption

9. Frank is tasked with ensuring the authenticity and integrity of software updates in his organization. He decides to use a cryptographic technique that uses a public-private key pair. What is this technique called?

    A) Symmetric Encryption
    B) Asymmetric Encryption
    C) Digital Signatures
    D) Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

10. Grace, a security engineer, discovered that her company's encrypted communications could be vulnerable to an attack where an adversary might try every possible key to decrypt a ciphertext. What is this type of attack called?

    A) Man-in-the-middle attack
    B) Replay attack
    C) Brute-force attack
    D) Phishing attack

### Answers

7. C) AES - The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

8. C) Diffie-Hellman key exchange - The Diffie-Hellman protocol is specifically designed for secure key exchange over a public channel.

9. C) Digital Signatures - Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography and provide assurance of the authenticity and integrity of data.

10. C) Brute-force attack - In a brute-force attack, an attacker tries all possible combinations of keys until the correct one is found.
